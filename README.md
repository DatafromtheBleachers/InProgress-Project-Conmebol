# Introduction
The CONMEBOL World Cup qualifications is known as one of the toughest qualification events in the world. The event has had different formats, but since 1998 it has maintained its current format.

As of today, the table stands as shown:

Only the first six teams qualify directly to the world and the 7th goes to a knock-out game with a team in Asia.

Making use of the information available in Wikipedia, I extracted the tables from 1998 until 2022

# Methodology

The process consisted in 3 stages:
1) [Importing and Cleaning data]()
2) [Data Visualization]()

# Results

Based on these results, I would say that obtaining 25 points is likely a secured direct spot into the Man's Soccer World Cup
